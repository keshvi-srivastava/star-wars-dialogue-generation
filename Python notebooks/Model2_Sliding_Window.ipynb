i can see you two are in love padme im worried about him', 'continuing i fear your relationship has confused him hes changed considerably since we returned', 'continuing padme im not telling the

chase', 'you are strong and wise anakin and i am very proud of you i have trained you since you were a small boy i have taught you everything i know and you have become a far greater jedi than i could ever hope to be and you have saved my life more times than i can remember but be patient anakin it wont be long before the council makes you a jedi master', 'continuing dont worry i have enough clones

you get there just dont take too long', 'laughing cato nemoidia for starters', 'very well the burden is on me not to destroy all the droids before you get there', 'save your energy', 'dont give up

done that yourself', 'your anger and your lust for power have already done that', 'continuing you have allowed this dark lord to twist your mind until now until now you have become the very thing you swore to destroy', 'your new empire', 'anakin my allegiance is to the republic to democracy', 'only a sith lord deals in absolutes i will do what i must', 'ive heard that before anakin but i never thought id hear it from you', 'continuing the flaw of power is arrogance', 'i have failed you anakin i was never able to teach you to think', 'from the sith anakin chancellor palpatine is evil', 'well

father', 'he was the best starpilot in the galaxy and a cunning warrior i understand youve become quite a good pilot yourself and he was a good friend which reminds me', 'i have something here for you your father wanted you to have this when you were old enough but your uncle wouldnt allow it he feared you might follow old obiwan on some damnedfool idealistic crusade like your father did', 'your fathers lightsaber this is the weapon of a jedi knight not as clumsy or as random as a blaster', 'an elegant weapon for a morecivilized time for over a thousand generations the jedi knights were the guardians of peace and justice in the old republic before the dark times before the empire', 'a young jedi named darth vader who was a pupil of mine until he turned to evil helped the empire hunt down and destroy the jedi knights he betrayed and murdered your father now the jedi are all but extinct vader was seduced by the dark side of the force', 'well the force is what gives the jedi his power

boy two droids and no questions asked', 'lets just say wed like to avoid any imperial entanglements', 'we havent that much with us but we could pay you two thousand now plus fifteen when we reach alderaan', 'ninetyfour', 'youll have to sell your speeder', 'it will be enough', 'if the ships as fast as hes boasting we ought to do well', 'how long before you can make the jump to light speed', 'i felt a great disturbance in the force as if millions of voices suddenly cried out in terror and were suddenly silenced i fear something terrible has happened', 'youd better get on with your exercises', 'remember a jedi can feel the force flowing through him', 'partially but it also obeys your commands', 'i suggest you try it again luke', 'this time let go your conscious self and act on instinct', 'your eyes can deceive you dont trust them', 'stretch out with your feelings', 'you see you can do it', 'in my experience theres no such thing as luck', 'thats good you have taken your first step into a larger world', 'destroyed by the empire', 'its an imperial fighter', 'no its a short range fighter', 'itd be as well to let it go its too far out of range', 'a fighter that size couldnt get this deep into space on its own', 'thats no moon its a space station', 'turn the ship around', 'you cant win but there are alternatives to fighting', 'leave that to me', 'whos the more foolish the fool or the fool who follows him', 'plug in he should be able to interpret the entire imperial computer network', 'i dont think you boys can help i must go alone', 'be patient luke stay and watch over the droids', 'they must be delivered safely or other star systems will suffer the same fate as alderaan your destiny lies along a different path from mine the force will be with you always', 'only a master of evil darth', 'you cant win darth if you strike me down i shall become more powerful than you can possibly imagine', 'run luke run', 'luke the force will be with you', 'use the force luke', 'let go luke', 'luke trust me', 'remember the force will be with you always', 'luke luke', 'you will go to the dagobah system', 'there you will learn from yoda the jedi master who instructed me', 'he will learn patience', 'was i any different when you taught me', 'so was i if youll remember', 'you dont know that', 'even yoda cannot see their fate', 'but you cannot control it this is a dangerous time for you when you will be tempted by the dark side of the force', 'it is you and your abilities the emperor wants that is why your friends are made to suffer', 'luke i dont want to lose you to the emperor the way i lost vader', 'patience', 'if you choose to face vader you will do it alone i cannot interfere', 'luke dont give in to hate that leads to the dark side', 'that boy is our last hope', 'yoda will always be with you', 'you father was seduced by the dark side of the force he ceased to be anakin skywalker and became darth vader when that happened the good man who was your father was destroyed so what i have told you was true from a certain point of view', 'luke youre going to find that many of the truths we cling to depend greatly on our own point of view', 'i dont blame you for being angry if i was wrong in what i did it certainly wouldnt have been for the first time you see what happened to your father was my fault', 'anakin was a good friend', 'when i first knew him your father was already a great pilot but i was amazed how strongly the force was with him i took it upon myself to train him as a jedi i thought that i could instruct him just as well as yoda i was wrong my pride has had terrible consequences for the galaxy', 'i also thought he could be turned back to the good side it couldnt be done he is more machine now than man twisted and evil', 'you cannot escape your destiny', 'vader humbled you when first you met him luke but that experience was part of your training it taught you among other things the value of patience had you not been so impatient to defeat vader then you could have finished your training here with yoda you would have been prepared', 'and did you help them it was they who had to save you you achieved little by rushing back prematurely i fear', 'to be a jedi luke you must confront and then go beyond the dark side the side your father couldnt get past impatience is the easiest door for you like your father only your father was seduced by what he found on the other side of the door and you have held firm youre no longer so reckless now luke you are strong and patient and now you must face darth vader again', 'then the emperor has already won you were our only hope', 'the other he spoke of is your twin sister', 'hmm to protect you both from the emperor you were hidden from your father when you were born the emperor knew as i did if anakin were to have any offspring they would be a threat to him that is the reason why your sister remains safely anonymous', 'your insight serves you well bury your feelings deep down luke they do you credit but they could be made to serve the emperor', 'when your father left he didnt know your mother was pregnant your mother and i knew he would find out eventually but we wanted to keep you both as safe as possible for as long as possible so i took you to live with my brother owen on tatooine and your mother took leia to live as the daughter of senator organa on alderaan', 'the organa household was highborn and politically quite powerful in that system leia became a princess by virtue of lineage no one knew shed been adopted of course but it was a title without real power since alderaan had long been a democracy even so the family continued to be politically powerful and leia following in her foster fathers path became a senator as well thats not all she became of course she became the leader of her cell in the alliance against the corrupt empire and because she had diplomatic immunity she was a vital link for getting information to the rebel cause thats what she was doing when her path crossed yours for her foster parents had always told her to contact me on tatooine if her troubles became desperate', 'she hasnt been trained in the ways of the jedi the way you have luke but the force is strong with her as it is with all of your family there is no avoiding the battle you must face and destroy vader']\n",
