couldnt get this deep into space on its own', 'thats no moon its a space station', 'turn the ship around', 'you cant win but there are alternatives to fighting', 'leave that to me', 'whos the more foolish the fool or the fool who follows him', 'plug in he should be able to interpret the entire imperial computer network', 'i dont think you boys can help i must go alone', 'be patient luke stay and watch over the droids', 'they must be delivered safely or other star systems will suffer the same fate as alderaan your destiny lies along a different path from mine the force will be with you always', 'only a master of evil darth', 'you cant win darth if you strike me down i shall become more powerful than you can possibly imagine', 'run luke run', 'luke the force will be with you', 'use the force luke', 'let go luke', 'luke trust me', 'remember the force will be with you always', 'luke luke', 'you will go to the dagobah system', 'there you will learn from yoda the jedi master who instructed me', 'he will learn patience', 'was i any different when you taught me', 'so was i if youll remember', 'you dont know that', 'even yoda cannot see their fate', 'but you cannot control it this is a dangerous time for you when you will be tempted by the dark side of the force', 'it is you and your abilities the emperor wants that is why your friends are made to suffer', 'luke i dont want to lose you to the emperor the way i lost vader', 'patience', 'if you choose to face vader you will do it alone i cannot interfere', 'luke dont give in to hate that leads to the dark side', 'that boy is our last hope', 'yoda will always be with you', 'you father was seduced by the dark side of the force he ceased to be anakin skywalker and became darth vader when that happened the good man who was your father was destroyed so what i have told you was true from a certain point of view', 'luke youre going to find that many of the truths we cling to depend greatly on our own point of view', 'i dont blame you for being angry if i was wrong in what i did it certainly wouldnt have been for the first time you see what happened to your father was my fault', 'anakin was a good friend', 'when i first knew him your father was already a great pilot but i was amazed how strongly the force was with him i took it upon myself to train him as a jedi i thought that i could instruct him just as well as yoda i was wrong my pride has had terrible consequences for the galaxy', 'i also thought he could be turned back to the good side it couldnt be done he is more machine now than man twisted and evil', 'you cannot escape your destiny', 'vader humbled you when first you met him luke but that experience was part of your training it taught you among other things the value of patience had you not been so impatient to defeat vader then you could have finished your training here with yoda you would have been prepared', 'and did you help them it was they who had to save you you achieved little by rushing back prematurely i fear', 'to be a jedi luke you must confront and then go beyond the dark side the side your father couldnt get past impatience is the easiest door for you like your father only your father was seduced by what he found on the other side of the door and you have held firm youre no longer so reckless now luke you are strong and patient and now you must face darth vader again', 'then the emperor has already won you were our only hope', 'the other he spoke of is your twin sister', 'hmm to protect you both from the emperor you were hidden from your father when you were born the emperor knew as i did if anakin were to have any offspring they would be a threat to him that is the reason why your sister remains safely anonymous', 'your insight serves you well bury your feelings deep down luke they do you credit but they could be made to serve the emperor', 'when your father left he didnt know your mother was pregnant your mother and i knew he would find out eventually but we wanted to keep you both as safe as possible for as long as possible so i took you to live with my brother owen on tatooine and your mother took leia to live as the daughter of senator organa on alderaan', 'the organa household was highborn and politically quite powerful in that system leia became a princess by virtue of lineage no one knew shed been adopted of course but it was a title without real power since alderaan had long been a democracy even so the family continued to be politically powerful and leia following in her foster fathers path became a senator as well thats not all she became of course she became the leader of her cell in the alliance against the corrupt empire and because she had diplomatic immunity she was a vital link for getting information to the rebel cause thats what she was doing when her path crossed yours for her foster parents had always told her to contact me on tatooine if her troubles became desperate', 'she hasnt been trained in the ways of the jedi the way you have luke but the force is strong with her as it is with all of your family there is no avoiding the battle you must face and destroy vader']\n",
